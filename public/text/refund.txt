# **CANCELLATION**

There are 3 ways in which orders can be cancelled:

1. By the Buyer&#39;s (or Customer&#39;s) request
2. By Seller&#39;s (or Merchant&#39;s) request
3. By DoctorOnCall Platform

Refund will be credited into the Buyer&#39;s credit card or bank account depending on the period of time the Buyer&#39;s financial institution is required to arrange for the refund.

## **By Buyer&#39;s request**

Buyers can cancel orders without Seller&#39;s approval **before** the **order has been arranged for shipment.** However, once the order has been arranged for shipment, buyer cancellations will need to be approved by the Seller.

## **By Sellers&#39; request**

In the case where the Seller is **not able to fulfil the order** (e.g. out of stock), the Seller can cancel the order. Seller will need to notify the Buyer that the order has been cancelled within **two (2) working days** of receiving the order.

## **By DoctorOnCall Platform**

Orders can also be **cancelled by DoctorOnCall Platform** when a Seller does not respond to a buyer&#39;s cancellation request within **2 days**.
